# Advent of Code 2019 in Dart

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This repository contains the (work in progress) solutions written in Dart by me ([@passsy](https://twitter.com/passsy)).

While solving the puzzles my main goal is to work with the [kt_dart](https://github.com/passsy/kt.dart/) and [dartx](https://github.com/leisim/dartx) packages to find missing APIs and to challenge existing ones.
